    Sup Brandon! 
    I made this folder bc I think it's very convenient to just leave notes here and inform the other person what we've worked on and what we will do~
    I intended it to be smt like a captain's (crew) journal so we can always track back in time of what we have done.
    We can use it to leave additional notes besides messaging on slack and actually meeting~
    Specific notes can be included in the front-end.txt and back-end.txt~
    Tell me what you think! @_@
