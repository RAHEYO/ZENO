    1. Added our custom color palette to the tailwind.css config, commited to front-end branch
    2. More layouts are completed, now you can see the navbar on the left-side, although functionality is not yet implemented~
    NextStep:
        1. I'll make the functionality work
        2. Make things pretteir?
        3. Actually start making those pages like channels, and attempt to make a board (canvas)?

    Summary: I built a simple front-end layout for the HomeSpace today, space = server.
    Notes:
        * The features aren't completed yet, they are there to show a general layout.
        * The Dummies folder is consists of some dummy data only for development before we have a fully usable back-end, feel free to modify the file~
    Details see in the front-end journal...

    Sup Brandon! 
    I made this folder bc I think it's very convenient to just leave notes here and inform the other person what we've worked on and what we will do~
    I intended it to be smt like a captain's (crew) journal so we can always track back in time of what we have done.
    We can use it to leave additional notes besides messaging on slack and actually meeting~
    Specific notes can be included in the front-end.txt and back-end.txt~
    Tell me what you think! @_@
