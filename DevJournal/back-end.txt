    Added sql files, preparing to connect with MySQL.
    Added UserChannelBond object, which stores the relationship between an user and a channel containing the permissions information...

    NextStep:
        1. Modify the front-end to use this new data type.
        2. Interact with an actual local database host.

    pages/api/mysql.ts includes basic mysql 2 codes rn.
    For now it's only working locally on my machine, however, you can look through my slack messages on how to set mysql up on ur computer in case u wanna debug or play around~ (Feel free!)

    NextStep:
        * Working out the data structures for this application, after racing through the dev of the front-end pages~

    This is the notes for back-end, I'll be consistently posting new updates about it!
    You can always ask questions or inform me what to back-end features you want and I'll try to make an update on it.
    As for now, I envision us using the MySql database, a very traditional approach but also reliable & fast.
