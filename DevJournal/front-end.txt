    First time writing in this thing lol
    Scaled the image down to the size I wanted. Whiteboard was just a test imo. Later, I'll make the corners rounded
    and add more features. It's super late lol

    Due to the change in the data structure, I organized the front-end code a little bit and added more comments to explain.
    Also, the UI for NavSecondary can be modified as we the data structure for Channels and Spaces are clear~
    GOOD LUCK BRANDON!

    Navigation working, actual contents needed to be implemented.
    Notes:
        * All the spaces have a route of '/spaces/[id]', except for the user's personal space which is just the app root '/'
        * I added a Utils.js file in spaces folder to contain general purpose functions, you can add custom methods such as converting time etc.

Ryan June 26th 11:34 AM:
    I separated the {RootNavbar} into 2 components, a {NavPrimary} for the left-most navigation btw Spaces, and {NavSecondary} right next to it for navigation btw Channels
    Note that the first space of NavPrimary is default the current user's space, where they can keep track of their performance

    Brandon: can you try to code a board, like a big canvas of which people can drag and drop things around?

    Explanation:
        1. I commented the initial page that Next.js generates by default, so maybe we can borrow their styling in the future, dw about it~
        2. I named the highest level component of the website "Root" (path '/'), default rendering the HomeSpace
        3. The {Components} folder is meant to simplify code, highly reusable components are stored in the {General} subfolder,
            and layouts or wrapper components are stored in the {Layout} subfolder
        4. Also notice that the colors are just random, I'll be implenting the colors that we decided on next
        5. Navigation is unavailable rn, just a dummy layout~

    This is the front-end! I guess it'll look something like this in a few months:

            Brandon Auguest 19th 9:13 AM: Finished the tab bar, but still need to integrate new packages, Ryan you can do that!
            Ryan Augest 20th 13:45 PM: Uhh OK, I'll try @_@
        }
