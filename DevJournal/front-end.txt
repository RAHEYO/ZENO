    Explanation:
        1. I commented the initial page that Next.js generates by default, so maybe we can borrow their styling in the future, dw about it~
        2. I named the highest level component of the website "Root" (path '/'), default rendering the HomeSpace
        3. The {Components} folder is meant to simplify code, highly reusable components are stored in the {General} subfolder,
            and layouts or wrapper components are stored in the {Layout} subfolder
        4. Also notice that the colors are just random, I'll be implenting the colors that we decided on next
        5. Navigation is unavailable rn, just a dummy layout~

            Ryan Augest 20th 13:45 PM: Uhh OK, I'll try @_@
        }
